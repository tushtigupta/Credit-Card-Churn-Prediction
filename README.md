# Credit-Card-Churn-Prediction
📊 Credit Card Churn Prediction

Credit Card Churn Prediction is a machine learning project designed to identify customers who are likely to stop using a credit card service (i.e., churn) based on historical customer data. By predicting churn early, businesses can take proactive actions to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

🔍 Project Overview

In this project, I built a predictive model that analyzes customer behavior and attributes to estimate the likelihood of churn. The model helps financial institutions understand patterns that contribute to churn and enables data-driven decision making for customer engagement strategies.
